In the Git + GitHub training, I learned about the purposes and functionalities of Git and GitHub, how to use them, what is the workflow and the main commands used.

Challenges you faced while completing the tasks.
- understanding the workflow
New things you learned from the hands-on experience.
- to be patient
Any feedback or questions you might have about the training.
- nothing so far
